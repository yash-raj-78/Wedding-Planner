# Wedding-Planner

The project is not complete, work is still going on

A Wedding Planner Project allows users to plan and organize weddings effectively. Built with **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP**, it includes features like guest list management, task tracking, budget planning, and venue booking. The front end (HTML/CSS/JavaScript) provides an interactive and responsive user interface, while the back end (PHP) manages database interactions for storing and retrieving wedding details securely.
